The label-to-ID mapping (l2i) assigns unique integer IDs to sorted unique labels. If multiple tokens have the same frequency, Python’s most_common() method returns them in order of frequency; in case of equal frequency, it returns the item that it outputs them in the order that they were encountered. \n",

In the final task of this lab, you will run a small experiment to see how alternative initialisations can affect a model’s performance.\n",

However, research suggests other approaches may work better. For example, you have seen that embedding layers share similarities with linear layers, so it makes sense to use the same initialisation method for both. The default initialisation method for linear layers in PyTorch is the so-called Kaiming initialisation, introduced by [He et al.
